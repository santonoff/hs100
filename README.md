# hs100

A tool for using TP-Link HS100/HS103/HS105/HS110/HS300 wi-fi smart plugs and KL110 smart bulbs.
You can turn them on and off, reboot them, and so on. You can even set them up without using TP-Link's app (see Initial Setup).

Tested to work on Linux, OSX, IRIX, and Windows under WSL.  Code modified to be compatible
with Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition to run under native Windows 11.

Loosely based on [pyHS100](https://github.com/GadgetReactor/pyHS100) and
[research from softScheck](https://www.softscheck.com/en/reverse-engineering-tp-link-hs110/).

## Usage

`hs100 <ip> <command>`

Commands:
- `associate <ssid> <key> <key_type>`: set wifi AP to connect to. get your
key\_type by doing a scan
- `info`: get device information including device IDs
- `emeter`: realtime power consumption (works with HS110 and HS300)
- `factory-reset`: reset the plug to factory settings
- `off`: turn the power off
- `on`: turn the power on
- `reboot`: reboot the plug
- `scan`: scan for nearby wifi APs (probably only 2.4 GHz ones)
- `set_server <url>`: set cloud server to \<url\> instead of TP-Link's
- Alternatively, you can supply a JSON string to be sent directly to the
device. Note that the JSON string must be quoted, like so:
`hs100 <ip> '{"system":{"set_relay_state":{"state":1}}}'`

### Use with Outlet Strips (such as HS300)

The `emeter`, `off` and `on` commands can be used on the individual outlets of multiple outlet strips.

- use the `info` command to get the ID string of the outlet you want to control
- append the ID string to the command line for `emeter`, `off` or `on` like so:
`hs100 <ip> on 80062947BE0A1339DC7914B75B24A6A51FB6977E02`

## Initial Setup

According to TP-Link, initial setup of the plugs is performed by installing
their "Kasa" app on your smartphone (free account required), and using its
setup tool. This sucks and I do not recommend it. Instead, follow these
alternative instructions.

You want to get the plug into the "blinking amber and blue" state, in which
it will spin up its own AP and await commands. If you have a brand new plug,
then it should do this automatically. Otherwise, hold down one of the buttons
(depending on your model) for about 5 seconds, until its light blinks amber
and blue.

You should see a wifi AP called "TP-Link\_Smart Plug\_XXXX" or similar.
Connect to this AP. You will be given an IP of 192.168.0.100, with the plug
at 192.168.0.1.

Issue the following commands to the plug:
- Factory reset the plug to get rid of any settings from a previous owner:
`hs100 192.168.0.1 factory-reset`. You will be disconnected from its wifi AP.
Once the factory reset is done (usually a few seconds), reconnect to the
plug's AP.
- Disable cloud nonsense by setting a bogus server URL: `hs100 192.168.0.1 set_server localhost`
- Scan for your wifi AP using `hs100 192.168.0.1 scan`. Find your AP in the
list and note its `key_type`; you will need this to associate.
- Associate with your AP using `hs100 192.168.0.1 associate <ssid> <password> <key_type>`
. Your key\_type is a number that indicates the kind of wifi security that
your AP is using. You can find it by doing a wifi scan (see previous step).

If the light turns solid amber, then it was unable to associate-- factory
reset the plug and try again. Otherwise, the light on your plug will change
first to blinking blue, then to solid blue indicating that it has successfully
connected to your AP.

For the KL110 (and other Kasa Smart Bulbs), the commands are:
kl110_on - turn on the bulb
kl110_off - turn off the bulb
kl110_dim xx - set the bulb to xx dim level

If the file is executed via the name "kl110" rather than "hs100", the 
"on", "off" and "dim" commands are redirected to the kl110 versions.  
Either copy, rename or create a link to access the file
with the make kl110.  To create links, us the ln command in 
Linux or the mklink command in Windows.

## Build

Ubuntu instructions
You will need `build-essential` installed. Then run `make`. This will produce a `hs100` binary which you can use. E.g. `./hs100 192.168.0.1 off`
For Windows, install the community edition of Visual Studio.  Use the cl command to compile/link the executable.

## Todo

- better error checking
- plug discovery

This program is very basic. Patches welcome!
